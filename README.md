# sfinder-companion

This program is meant to be used in conjunction with this one developed by knewjade: https://github.com/knewjade/solution-finder/

To use, simply put the .bat (or .exe) file in the same directory that you extracted/installed solution finder into. If done incorrectly, the program will alert you.

From there, simply run the .bat or .exe file, and you'll be guided through the process from there.
