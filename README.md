# sfinder-companion
Meant as a companion tool to the excellent sfinder made by knewjade which can be downloaded at the link below 

This program is meant to be used in conjunction with this one developed by knewjade: https://github.com/knewjade/solution-finder/

To use, simply put the .bat (or .exe) file in the same directory that you extracted/installed solution finder into. If done incorrectly, the program will alert you.

From there, simply run the .bat or .exe file, and you'll be guided through the process from there.
